## Twitter in 2012 VS 2022
I found the article [Twitter Architecture 2022 vs 2012](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/twitter-architecture-2022-vs-2012) by Alex Xu very interesting. Alex uses two graphs to compare Twitter's architecture in 2012 and 2022. The article also touches on SSO, which is a service that we are using daily when we log into our Brightspace, Zoom, Gmail, etc. I think from this article gives me a snapshot of modern web apps' tech stacks and explains them in plain English without going too deep and making me feel lost.
