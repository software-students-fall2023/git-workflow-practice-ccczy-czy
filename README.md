Here's the article I found interesting.

## Twitter in 2012 VS 2022
I found the article [Twitter Architecture 2022 vs 2012](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/twitter-architecture-2022-vs-2012) by Alex Xu very interesting. Alex uses two graphs to compare Twitter's architecture in 2012 and 2022. The article also touches on SSO, which is a service that we are using daily when we log into our Brightspace, Zoom, Gmail, etc. I think from this article gives me a snapshot of modern web apps' tech stacks and explains them in plain English without going too deep and making me feel lost.

The graphs were interesting to me but from a different perspective. I recently watched a video titled "[I Feel Bad For New Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL88IAxoYOk&t=525s)" which details the fact that modern programmers have so much more to learn and also learn CS topics from a higher level of abstraction compared to programmers in the past. For example, the Youtuber says that modern programmers/bootcampers already start off with react, databases, browsers, servers as a baseline but have to even learn things like Solid, Go, HTML templates etc. Compare this to his past experience where the learning is very direct such as data structures and coding networks with sockets. From the graphs, we clearly see this expansion of requirements and complexity in coding. The architecture used to just be built on the API and span out to three services. Now, Twitter is comprised of a multitude of aspects, such as GraphQL, Home Ranker, Home Mixers. All of these require a further understanding of various technologies and systems than the past to build.

## Comments

Jason Zhang: The article explains how data is encapsulated and de-encapsulated when transmitting over a network, including the layered approach and headers used at each step, providing a clear and fundamental understanding of network communication processes.
